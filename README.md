ImageJ (Version 1.54j) macro's:

The "PLA v2.40.ijm" script was created to simplify the automated analysis of Proximal Ligation Assays (PLA) assays by Dr Andrew Law.
(https://github.com/andlaw1841/Andy-s-Algorithm/blob/master/README.md)
In the PLA v2.40-BNmodif2024.ijm some modifications were added by me to add to the "PLA summary" output file:
    total of nuclei with 0 signal
    total of nuclei with 1 signal
    total of nuclei with more signals
    Average signal within nuclei with more signals
The "save Zeis.CZI as 3 Ch.tif -BN.ijm" script makes it easier to import image.czi in ImageJ and save the individual channels as Tiff image.
Take as it is, no garanties delivered..
