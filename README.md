ImageJ (Version 1.54j) macro's:

The "PLA v2.40.ijm" script was created by Dr Andrew Law, to simplify the automated analysis of Proximal Ligation Assays (PLA) assays.
(https://github.com/andlaw1841/Andy-s-Algorithm/blob/master/README.md).

In the "PLA v2.40-BNmodif2024.ijm" some modifications were added by me to add to the "PLA summary" output file:

    total of nuclei with 0 signal, with average of total nulei
    
    total of nuclei with 1 signal, with average of total nuclei
    
    total of nuclei with more signals, with average of total nuclei
    
    Average signal within nuclei with more signals
    

The "save Zeis.CZI as 3 Ch.tif -BN.ijm" script makes it easier to import image.czi in ImageJ and save the individual channels as Tiff image.

Take as it is, no garanties given..
